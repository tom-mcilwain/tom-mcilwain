Hello world, my name is Tom McIlwain.

I am a computational bioengineer seeking a full-time position in the neurotechnology industry working to develop technologies that interface with the nervous system in order to better people's mental health and overall quality of life. I recently completed my MS in Bioengineering at Stanford University where I concentrated in machine learning for healthcare and neuroscience. Previously, I attended the University of Washington where I received a BS in Bioengineering.

In my github profile, you will find repositories containing some of my previous projects from my coursework and research. Most of these projects are related to signal processing, machine learning, and neurotechnology.
